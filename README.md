This is a polynomial processing system. You can manipulate the application by following several steps: you read the indications and then 
enter the required data. You complete one or two TextFields (it depends on the operation) with the input and press the button you want.
There are six buttons, one for each operation: addition, subtraction, multiplying, derivation, integration and also one for data reset.
Once you enter a valid data and press a button, the result will be displayed in the third TextField. Otherwise, an error message will 
be reported. The user can handle the reset button in order to clean the contents of the fields.
